### Project Description
It‚Äôs a fun and interactive website that takes any given noun as input and instantly converts it into its matching representative emoji.
This helps users visualize words in a playful way, making communication more expressive and engaging. 
Perfect for chatting, learning, or just having fun with language.

### The Problem 
People often read short stories or text messages without much visual engagement.
Although emojis are fun, manually replacing every noun in a story with its matching emoji is time-consuming and impractical.
Most readers won‚Äôt bother to do it themselves, and storytellers miss a quirky, playful way to present their text

### The Solution 

Takes a story (text) as input.

Identifies nouns automatically using a simple parts-of-speech (POS) tagging method.

Replaces each noun with a corresponding emoji from a predefined dictionary (e.g., ‚Äúcat‚Äù ‚Üí üê±, ‚Äúsun‚Äù ‚Üí ‚òÄÔ∏è).

Outputs the modified story ‚Äî where nouns are swapped for emojis ‚Äî while keeping the rest of the sentence intact for readability.
